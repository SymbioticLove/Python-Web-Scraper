# Initialize Bookmarks Module Documentation

This module provides functionality to initialize a bookmarks file.

## Dependencies

- tkinter: Python's standard GUI package.

## Functions

### initialize_bookmarks_file()

This function initializes the 'bookmarks.txt' file by writing an empty string to it. 

If an error is encountered during file operations, a tkinter messagebox is used to display the error to the user.

#### Parameters:

None

#### Returns:

None

This function follows these main steps:

1. Tries to open 'bookmarks.txt' in write mode.
2. Writes an empty string to the file, effectively clearing its contents or initializing it if it doesn't exist.
3. Catches and handles any exceptions that may occur during these file operations, and uses a tkinter messagebox to display any error messages.
