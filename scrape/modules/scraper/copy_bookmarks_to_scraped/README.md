# Copy Bookmarks Module Documentation

This module provides functionality to manage bookmarks and scraped data.

## Dependencies

- tkinter: Python's standard GUI package.
- os: Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.

## Functions

### copy_bookmarks_to_scraped()

This function copies the contents of the 'bookmarks.txt' file to the 'scraped.txt' file, then clears 'bookmarks.txt'. 

If an error is encountered during file operations, a tkinter messagebox is used to display the error to the user.

#### Parameters:

None

#### Returns:

None

This function follows these main steps:

1. Reads the contents of 'bookmarks.txt'.
2. Appends the content to 'scraped.txt', adding a newline separator if 'scraped.txt' is not empty.
3. Clears 'bookmarks.txt' by writing an empty string to it.
4. Handles any exceptions that may occur during these file operations and uses a tkinter messagebox to display any error messages.
