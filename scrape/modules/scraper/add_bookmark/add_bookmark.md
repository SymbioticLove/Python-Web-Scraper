# Add Bookmark Module Documentation

This module is based on the Python Tkinter library, which provides a powerful object-oriented interface for GUI programming. This specific module focuses on adding bookmarks.

## Dependencies

- tkinter: Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk.

- tkinter.messagebox: A module used to display message boxes in your applications.

## Functions

### add_bookmark(url_entry)

Add a new bookmark to the bookmarks file. It accepts a tkinter Entry widget as an argument where the user enters the URL to bookmark. It then checks if the URL already exists in the bookmarks file or if it has already been scraped. If neither is the case, it appends the new URL to the bookmarks file. 

#### Parameters:

- url_entry (tkinter.Entry): A tkinter Entry widget where the user enters the URL to bookmark.

#### Returns:

- None

In case of an error, it will display a messagebox with the corresponding error message.

## Exception Handling

This function has a broad exception handling clause which will catch any exception, log an error message, and then continue the program execution. This can be beneficial as it prevents the entire program from crashing if a single operation fails.
